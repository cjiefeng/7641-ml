# Unsupervised Learning

# Overview
Performing unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, and combination of both.  
The last part of the repo describe methods in combining these unsupervised learning techniques into a supervised learning problem.  

# Getting started
Create virtual python environment and install requirements from `../requirements.txt`.

# Dataset
- Bank churn data (`data/bank.csv`)
- Income data (`data/adult.data`)

# Notebooks
clustering:
- income_clustering.ipynb
- bank_clustering.ipynb

dimensionality reduction:
- income_dim_red.ipynb
- bank_dim_red.ipynb

combining clustering and dimensionality reduction:
- income_dim_red_clustering.ipynb
- bank_dim_red_clustering.ipynb

neural network:
- incoming_nn.ipynb
- incom_cluster_nn.ipynb
