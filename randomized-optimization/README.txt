# Supervised Learning

# Overview
Explore random search algorithms. 
- 1st problem: identify optimization problem domains most suitable for random search algorithms
- 2nd problem: use random search algorithm to learn neural network weights 

# Getting started
Create virtual python environment and install requirements from `../requirements.txt`.

# Dataset
- Bank churn data (`data/bank.csv`)

# Notebooks
## Optimization problems
- flipflop.ipynb: RHC / SA most suitable
- knapsack.ipynb: GA most suitable
- four_peaks.ipynb: GA most suitable
- k_colors.ipynb: Mimic most suitable

## Neural networks 
- rhc_nn.ipynb
- sa_nn.ipynb
- ga_nn.ipynb
- adam_nn.ipynb (benchmark copied from assignment 1)
